## Food Safety

**Room temperature limit: 2 hours max.** Rice can harbor *Bacillus cereus*, a spore-forming bacterium that survives cooking. The toxins it produces are **odorless and tasteless** — spoiled rice will not smell or taste off. Refrigerate within 2 hours (1 hour if it's hot). Reheat to 165°F throughout.
