- 350 ml water
- 50 ml vinegar (5% acidity)
- 20 g salt (5% of fluid weight)
- 20 g sugar (5% of fluid weight)

Heat and stir the mixture to a simmer to help the salt and sugar
dissolve.

The above quantities should work for a 1-pint (473 ml) jar. Double the
quantities for a 1-quart (946 ml) jar.

I've had good results with these proportions before; I liked the flavor
a bit better than using 400 ml water with no vinegar.

## Food Safety Note (2026-02-26)

This is a REFRIGERATOR pickle recipe — the low vinegar ratio (7:1
water:vinegar) is acceptable because cold storage is the primary
preservative. Keep refrigerated and consume within 2-3 weeks.

**For shelf-stable canning, different rules apply:**
- The "50/50 rule" recommends at least 1:1 vinegar:water for fresh-pack
  pickles meant for room-temperature storage
- This prevents botulism by ensuring pH stays below 4.6

**Salt is NOT a safety preservative for quick pickles:**
- Salt only preserves in LACTO-FERMENTED pickles (where it creates the
  environment for beneficial bacteria to produce lactic acid)
- In quick/vinegar pickles, salt is purely for flavor
- For safety, rely on vinegar acidity + heat processing (canning) or
  refrigeration (quick pickles)

If attempting shelf-stable pickles, either use a tested recipe from a
reputable source (USDA, NCHFP, university extension) or maintain at
least 1:1 vinegar:water ratio with proper heat processing.
